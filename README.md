# Merging Geometry with Machine Learning

![Image Alt text](/assets/images/Lines.png)

# About me
I graduated in 2001 as an Electronics engineer and started a career in industry before becoming a lecturer and research coordinator at the Karel de Grote Hogeschool. My main teaching topics were Unity3D game engine, AR/VR and machine learning. Currently I'm a PhD student at the University of Antwerp (expected date of defense is May 2024). My work focusses on Gaussian processes for the calibration of 3D measuring devices. My interest are probabilistic numerics and how to intertwine them with 3D line geometry.

## Network on GPs
In December 2019 we launched an interdisciplinary interest group regarding the possibilities and the challenges of Gaussian Processes. The objective was (and still is) the organic expansion of a platform for discussions and sharing of ideas on theoretical contributions and practical applications, creating a fertile soil for future cooperation and project proposals. We have had the pleasure to welcome various speakers such as professor Søren Hauberg (Technical University of Denmark), professor Stephen Roberts (Oxford University), professor Carl Henrik Ek (Cambridge University) and many more. Find all of them [here](https://www.invilab.be/research/network-on-gaussian-processes/). Do not hesitate to contact me if you want to get involved.

## Misc
- I regularly review for IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, Springer Autonomous Intelligent Systems and Springer Nonlinear Dynamics.
- I also review for VLAIO (afdeling Innovatiesteun van het Agentschap Innoveren & Ondernemen) as an expert on AI and AR/VR.
- Best paper award for my paper "IMMERSIMED: A Future-Proof Immersive Platform for Medical Training" at the SCIFI-IT’2018 Conference (April 18-20 2018).
