# About me
I graduated with a degree in Electronics Engineering in 2001 and worked in industry for a while. Later, I became a lecturer and research coordinator at Karel de Grote Hogeschool, teaching Unity3D game engine, AR/VR, and machine learning. I completed my PhD at the University of Antwerp's Industrial Vision Group (InViLab), focusing on Gaussian processes for 3D measurements. Currently, I'm a postdoctoral researcher working on using Gaussian processes to calibrate unconventional cameras. My main interest involves uncertainty quantification and how it can be combined with 3D projective geometry to discover hidden strucures in data.

## Network on Gaussian Processes
In December 2019 we launched an interdisciplinary interest group regarding the possibilities and the challenges of Gaussian Processes. The objective was (and still is) the organic expansion of a platform for discussions and sharing of ideas on theoretical contributions and practical applications, creating a fertile soil for future cooperation and project proposals. We have had the pleasure to welcome various speakers such as professor Søren Hauberg (Technical University of Denmark), professor Stephen Roberts (Oxford University), professor Carl Henrik Ek (Cambridge University) and many more. Find all of them [here](https://www.invilab.be/research/network-on-gaussian-processes/). Do not hesitate to contact me if you want to get involved.
